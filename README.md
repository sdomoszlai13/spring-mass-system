# Spring Mass System Simulation

This progam simulates a system of an arbitrary number of masses, fixtures and springs in a gravity field.

When the fixtures, masses and spings are set up, the forces acting on the masses are calculated. This in turn allows to calculate their velocity and position. These steps are repeated for every time step. The trajectories of the masses can be plotted.
